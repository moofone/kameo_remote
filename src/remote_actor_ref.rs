/// A remote actor reference with a cached connection for zero-lookup message sending.
///
/// This is returned by `lookup()` and provides `tell()`, `ask()`, and `ask_streaming_bytes()`
/// methods that use the cached connection directly (no hashmap lookups, just pointer deref).
///
/// # Resource Management
///
/// `RemoteActorRef` uses weak references to prevent memory leaks:
/// - `registry: Weak<GossipRegistry>` - doesn't prevent registry cleanup
/// - `connection: Option<Arc<Mutex<ConnectionHandle>>>` - optional strong ref
///
/// When the registry shuts down, `tell()`/`ask()` will return `Err(Shutdown)`.
/// Connections are cleaned up by periodic `cleanup_stale_connections()` calls.
///
/// # Connection Optional for Unstarted Actors
///
/// For actors that are registered but not yet listening (e.g., during testing),
/// `connection` may be `None`. In this case, `tell()`/`ask()` will attempt to
/// establish the connection lazily on first use.
///
/// # DNS Reconnection (Kubernetes Pod Restarts)
///
/// When a peer's IP changes due to DNS refresh (e.g., Kubernetes pod restart):
/// - The old TCP connection dies and is removed from the connection pool
/// - `RemoteActorRef` detects this on the next `tell()`/`ask()` call
/// - It automatically reconnects to the peer using the updated peer_id→addr mapping
/// - Subsequent messages use the fresh connection (zero additional lookups)
///
/// This provides **self-healing** behavior - no manual re-lookup needed!
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// // Step 1: Lookup does ALL the work - finds actor AND caches connection
/// let remote_actor = registry.lookup("chat_service").await?;
///
/// // Step 2: tell/ask use cached connection - ZERO lookups, just pointer deref
/// remote_actor.tell(message1).await?;
/// remote_actor.tell(message2).await?;
/// remote_actor.ask(request).await?;
///
/// // Even if peer's IP changes (pod restart), RemoteActorRef auto-reconnects!
