# kameo_remote

`kameo_remote` is a high-throughput, TLS-only transport + registry layer for remote actor discovery and request/response (tell/ask) style messaging.

## Highlights

- High-performance ring buffer: Lock-free ring buffer for tell/ask operations with future io_uring support for Linux 5.1+.
- TLS 1.3 only: all connections are encrypted and use Ed25519 node identities.
- Ask/response correlation tracking and streaming response protocol for large payloads.
- Zero-copy friendly payload paths (`bytes::Bytes`, aligned buffers, pooled typed payloads).

## DNS Refresh (Kubernetes IP Churn)

If a peer is configured with a `dns_name` (for example, a StatefulSet pod DNS name),
`kameo_remote` will re-resolve DNS on dial/reconnect failure before the next attempt.

For deterministic tests, you can inject a resolver:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use kameo_remote::{DnsResolver, GossipRegistryHandle, TokioDnsResolver};

// Default behavior uses Tokio DNS:
// handle.registry.set_dns_resolver(Arc::new(TokioDnsResolver::default())).await;
//
// Tests can provide a scripted resolver implementing `DnsResolver`.
```

## TLS Is Mandatory

TLS is not optional anymore. Creating a registry requires a `SecretKey` (or a `KeyPair`, which is converted to a `SecretKey` under the hood).

```rust
use kameo_remote::{GossipConfig, GossipRegistryHandle, SecretKey};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> kameo_remote::Result<()> {
    let secret = SecretKey::generate();
    let bind_addr = "127.0.0.1:0".parse().unwrap();

    let handle = GossipRegistryHandle::new_with_tls(bind_addr, secret, Some(GossipConfig::default())).await?;
    println!("listening on {}", handle.registry.bind_addr);

    handle.shutdown().await;
    Ok(())
}
```

## io_uring (Linux)

There is an `io_uring` feature flag intended for Linux 5.1+:

```bash
cargo build --features io_uring
```

This is currently a platform-specific optimization path; non-Linux platforms use the default Tokio networking path.

## Security Note

The old note about “not using proper cryptographic PeerId keys” is no longer accurate: `PeerId` is an Ed25519 public key, and TLS identities are derived from Ed25519 keys.

However, peer authentication is still intentionally permissive in places:

- Certificate parsing/identity extraction uses a simplified placeholder approach (not full X.509 parsing).
- Unless you encode an expected NodeId in SNI, the client verifier does not strictly pin the peer identity when connecting via IP.

If you need production-grade node identity verification, you should implement strict identity pinning (expected `PeerId`/`NodeId` per address) and replace the placeholder certificate parsing with proper X.509/SPKI extraction.
